# 🔋 Battery Gourd

## ❗ Problem Statement

Laptops often overcharge or run critically low on battery without users realizing it. This leads to:

**Battery Gourd** solves this by offering a lightweight, real-time battery monitoring web app with alert notifications, dark mode, sound toggles, and usage history – all in one responsive.
